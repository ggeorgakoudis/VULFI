# VULFI - An LLVM based Fault Injection Framework
## Introduction
VULFI is an open-source instruction-level fault injection framework developed using [LLVM compiler infrastructure](http://llvm.org/). VULFI performs fault injection at LLVM's intermediate representation (IR) level. It currently supports C, C++, [ISPC](https://ispc.github.io/), [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/), and MPI-C languages. Note that to target an OpenCL program for fault injection using VULFI, the program should be compiled using [Intel's OpenCL Compiler](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/530783). Conceptually, VULFI can target any high level language which can be compiled to [LLVM's intermediate representation](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html).

Vulfi supports all major LLVM versions starting from LLVM version 3.2. The top level vulfi directory has a master folder which contains the latest source code of VULFI supporting latest [LLVM version](http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk). The top level directory has additional folders starting with the prefix "LLVM_" with each folder containing vulfi source code supporting the respective version of LLVM. For example, the folder LLVM_32 contains the vulfi source code supporting LLVM version 3.2. It is our intention to keep vulfi update supporting the latest LLVM [development branch] (http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk) while also maintaining reasonable support for older versions of LLVM.

* CMake (version > 3.0) 
* Python (version > 2.7)
* Doxygen (version > 1.8.9)
* Graphviz (default version)

### License & Copyright Information
### Installation

##### Step 1: Download VULFI. 
```
git clone https://github.com/utahfmr/vulfi.github.io.git <vulfi dir>
```
where \<vulfi dir\> is the directory where you want vulfi source code to live.

##### Step 2: Choose the correct version of VULFI. 

If you would like to build VULFI using the latest LLVM version then go to "master" folder else refer to one of the folder starting with the prefix "LLVM_" represeting your LLVM version.

```
cd <vulfi dir>/master
```

##### Step 3: Create the build directory.

```
mkdir build
cd build
```

##### Step 4: Build & Install VULFI.

First, run cake to generate build scripts. If everything works fine then cmake should finish without errors.
```
cmake <vulfi dir>/master
```

Now, running make command should build VULFI library with the name LLVMVulfi.so.

```
make
```

After building VULFI, you could install vulfi by running below command. Please note that the default installation directory for VULFI is ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib. On linux systems, CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX points to /usr/local. 

```
sudo make install
```

To change the default installation directory of VULFI, you can use [DESTDIR](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html). An example commandline given below.

```
sudo make install DESTDIR=<my dir>
```

##### Step 4: Run examples.

VULFI has some sample examples written in C and C++ which can be located at <vulfi dir>/master/examples. You can look at the "common.mk" files inside "src" and "run" subdirectories to understand how VULFI can be used for fault injection. You can compile and run all examples in one go by running below commands.

```
cd <vulfi dir>/master/examples
make VULFI_SRC_DIR=<vulfi dir>/master VULFI_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/lib
```

Note that the variables VULFI_SRC_DIR and VULFI_INSTALL_DIR must be assigned absolute paths representing where VULFI source code lives and where VULFI library (LLVMVulfi.so) is installed respectively.



### Steps for using VULFI for Fault Injection
Before reading the below documentation, please ensure that you have already executed the examples explained in the previous section, and also inspected the "common.mk" files to understand how the instrumentation and execution processes are carried out. You could pretty much use those "common.mk" files to bootstrap your fault injection process. 


##### Step 1: Adding function calls.

First, locate the code file which has the main() function. 

If your target program is a C program then add below code snippet at the begining of the code file.

```
#ifdef INST
extern int printFaultSitesData(void);
extern int printFaultInjectionData(void);
#endif
```

If your target program is a C++ program then add below code snippet at the begining of the code file.


```
#ifdef INST
extern "C" int printFaultSitesData(void);
extern "C" int printFaultInjectionData(void);
#endif
```

Now, in the main() function, add below code snippet before all the return calls.

```
#ifdef INST
  printFaultSitesData();
  printFaultInjectionData();
#endif  
```


##### Command line options supported by VULFI

```
-fn  : Name(s) of the function(s) to be targeted
       Example: -fn "func1 func2 func3"

-fsa : Fault Site Selection Algorithm
       Options: 
        data: target all fault sites which only affect data instructions 
        (and don't affect control or address)
        dint: target all "data" fault sites of integer type (bitwdith >=2)
        dflo: target all "data" fault sites of floating-point type (both 
        single and double precision)
        ctrl: target all fault sites which affect control instructions.
        addr: target all fault sites which affect address instructions.
       Example: -fsa "data"
       Default Value: data
       

-lang : Target language
        Options: C/C++/ISPC/OCL
        Description: This information is used by VULFI to implement language 
        specific features.
        Example: -lang "C++"
        Default Value: C++

-arch : Target architecture
        Options: x86/neon/nvvm/mips/spu
        Description: This information is used by VULFI to implement arch
        specific features. Currently, "x86" is the only supported one.
        Example: -arch "x86"
        Default Value: x86
        
-dbf  : Debug file name with csv extension
        Description: this CSV file provides the list of static LLVM-IR instructions 
        that will be targeted for fault injection.
```

##### Step 2: Instrumentation.
Suppose, we have a code file foo.cpp containing functions foo1(), foo2(), and main(), that we want to target for fault injection. 

* As a first step, we need to manually add the code snippets described in Step 1. 

* Next, compile Corrupt.C (inside the runtime folder of VULFI) to LLVM bitcode as shown below.

```
clang++ <vulfi dir>/master/runtime/Corrupt.C -emit-llvm -c -o Corrupt.bc
```

* Now, compile foo.cpp as shown below.

```
clang++ foo.cp -emit-llvm -c -o foo.bc 
```

* We should now link both the bitcode files as shown below.

```
llvm-link Corrupt.bc foo.bc -o foo_corrupt.bc
```

* Finally, instrument the bitcode foo_corrupt.bc using VULFI. For example, if we can to target all "data" fault sites in functions foo1() and foo2() in foo.cpp code file, we should run below command.
 ```
opt -load /usr/local/lib/LLVMVulfi.so -vulfi -fn "foo1 foo2" -fsa "data" -lang "C++" -arch "x86" \
-dbgf "fault_sites_data_foo.csv" < foo_corrupt.bc > foo_instrument.bc

```
