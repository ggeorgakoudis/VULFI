# VULFI - An LLVM based Fault Injection Framework
## Introduction
VULFI is an open-source instruction-level fault injection framework developed using [LLVM compiler infrastructure](http://llvm.org/). VULFI performs fault injection at LLVM's intermediate representation (IR) level. It currently supports C, C++, [ISPC](https://ispc.github.io/), [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/), and MPI-C languages. Note that to target an OpenCL program for fault injection using VULFI, the program should be compiled using [Intel's OpenCL Compiler](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/530783). Conceptually, VULFI can target any high level language which can be compiled to [LLVM's intermediate representation](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html).

Vulfi supports all major LLVM versions starting from LLVM version 3.2. The top level vulfi directory has a master folder which contains the latest source code of VULFI supporting latest [LLVM version](http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk). The top level directory has additional folders starting with the prefix "LLVM_" with each folder containing vulfi source code supporting the respective version of LLVM. For example, the folder LLVM_32 contains the vulfi source code supporting LLVM version 3.2. It is our intention to keep vulfi update supporting the latest LLVM [development branch] (http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk) while also maintaining reasonable support for older versions of LLVM.
