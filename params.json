  "tagline": "",
  "body": "## Introduction\r\nVULFI is an open-source instruction-level fault injection framework developed using [LLVM compiler infrastructure](http://llvm.org/). VULFI performs fault injection at LLVM's intermediate representation (IR) level. It currently supports C, C++, [ISPC](https://ispc.github.io/), [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/), and MPI-C languages. Note that to target an OpenCL program for fault injection using VULFI, the program should be compiled using [Intel's OpenCL Compiler](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/530783). Conceptually, VULFI can target any high level language which can be compiled to [LLVM's intermediate representation](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html).\r\n\r\nVULFI supports all major LLVM versions starting from LLVM version 3.2. The top level VULFI directory has a master folder which contains the latest source code of VULFI supporting latest [LLVM version](http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk). Also, the top level directory has additional folders starting with the prefix \"LLVM_\" with each folder containing VULFI source code supporting the respective version of LLVM. For example, the folder LLVM_32 contains the VULFI source code supporting LLVM version 3.2. It is our intention to keep VULFI up-to-date supporting the latest LLVM [development branch] (http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk) while also maintaining reasonable support for older versions of LLVM.\r\n\r\n## People \r\n### Faculty & Collaborators\r\n* [Ganesh Gopalakrishnan](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~ganesh/)\r\n* [Sriram Krishnamoorthy](http://hpc.pnl.gov/people/sriram/)\r\n\r\n### Developers\r\n* [Vishal Sharma](https://sites.google.com/site/vishalutah/home)\r\n* Ian Briggs\r\n* Vinu Joseph\r\n* Arnab Das\r\n\r\n## Cite our work\r\nWhen you use VULFI in your research work, please cite our work using below citation information.
